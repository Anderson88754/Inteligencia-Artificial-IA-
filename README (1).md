### About GGUF

GGUF is a new format introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21st 2023. It is a replacement for GGML, which is no longer supported by llama.cpp.

Here is an incomplete list of clients and libraries that are known to support GGUF:

* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). The source project for GGUF. Offers a CLI and a server option.
* [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), the most widely used web UI, with many features and powerful extensions. Supports GPU acceleration.
* [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), a fully featured web UI, with GPU accel across all platforms and GPU architectures. Especially good for story telling.
* [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html), a free and open source local running GUI, supporting Windows, Linux and macOS with full GPU accel.
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), an easy-to-use and powerful local GUI for Windows and macOS (Silicon), with GPU acceleration. Linux available, in beta as of 27/11/2023.
* [LoLLMS Web UI](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui), a great web UI with many interesting and unique features, including a full model library for easy model selection.
* [Faraday.dev](https://faraday.dev/), an attractive and easy to use character-based chat GUI for Windows and macOS (both Silicon and Intel), with GPU acceleration.
* [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible API server.

## Compatibility

These quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit [d0cee0d](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221)

They are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.

## Explanation of quantisation methods

<details>
  <summary>Click to see details</summary>

The new methods available are:

* GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - "type-1" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)
* GGML_TYPE_Q3_K - "type-0" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q4_K - "type-1" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q5_K - "type-1" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw
* GGML_TYPE_Q6_K - "type-0" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw

## How to download GGUF files

**Note for manual downloaders:** You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.

The following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:

* LM Studio
* LoLLMS Web UI
* Faraday.dev

### In `text-generation-webui`

Under Download Model, you can enter the model repo: professorf/phi-3-mini-128k-f16-gguf and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: phi-3-mini-128k-f16.gguf

Then click Download.

### On the command line, including multiple files at once

I recommend using the `huggingface-hub` Python library:

```shell
pip3 install huggingface-hub
```

Then you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:

```shell
huggingface-cli download professorf/phi-3-mini-128k-f16-gguf phi-3-mini-128k-f16.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

For more documentation on downloading with `huggingface-cli`, please see: [HF -> Hub Python Library -> Download files -> Download from the CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/download#download-from-the-cli).

To accelerate downloads on fast connections (1Gbit/s or higher), install `hf_transfer`:

```shell
pip3 install hf_transfer
```

And set environment variable `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` to `1`:

```shell
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 huggingface-cli download professorf/phi-3-mini-128k-f16-gguf phi-3-mini-128k-f16.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Windows Command Line users: You can set the environment variable by running `set HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` before the download command.

<!-- README_GGUF.md-how-to-run start -->
## Example `llama.cpp` command

Make sure you are using `llama.cpp` from commit [d0cee0d](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221) or later.

```shell
./main -ngl 35 -m phi-3-mini-128k-f16.gguf --color -c 2048 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p "Instruct: {prompt}\nOutput:"
```

Change `-ngl 32` to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.

Change `-c 2048` to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.

If you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the `-p <PROMPT>` argument with `-i -ins`

For other parameters and how to use them, please refer to [the llama.cpp documentation](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/main/README.md)

## How to run in `text-generation-webui`

Further instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: [text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‚Äê Model Tab.md](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/04%20%E2%80%90%20Model%20Tab.md#llamacpp).

## How to run from Python code

You can use GGUF models from Python using the [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) or [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers) libraries. Note that at the time of writing (Nov 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated for some time and is not compatible with some recent models. Therefore I recommend you use llama-cpp-python.

### How to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python

For full documentation, please see: [llama-cpp-python docs](https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/).

  n_ctx=2048,  # The max sequence length to use - note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources
  n_threads=8,            # The number of CPU threads to use, tailor to your system and the resulting performance
  n_gpu_layers=35         # The number of layers to offload to GPU, if you have GPU acceleration available
)

# Simple inference example
output = llm(
  "Instruct: {prompt}\nOutput:", # Prompt
  max_tokens=512,  # Generate up to 512 tokens
  stop=["</s>"],   # Example stop token - not necessarily correct for this specific model! Please check before using.
  echo=True        # Whether to echo the prompt
)

# Chat Completion API

llm = Llama(model_path="./phi-3-mini-128k-f16.gguf", chat_format="llama-2")  # Set chat_format according to the model you are using
llm.create_chat_completion(

## Model Summary

The Phi-3-Mini-128K-Instruct is a 3.8 billion-parameter, lightweight, state-of-the-art open model trained using the Phi-3 datasets.
This dataset includes both synthetic data and filtered publicly available website data, with an emphasis on high-quality and reasoning-dense properties.
The model belongs to the Phi-3 family with the Mini version in two variants [4K](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) and [128K](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct) which is the context length (in tokens) that it can support.

After initial training, the model underwent a post-training process that involved supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to enhance its ability to follow instructions and adhere to safety measures.
When evaluated against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, mathematics, coding, long-term context, and logical reasoning, the Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct demonstrated robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with fewer than 13 billion parameters.
Resources and Technical Documentation:

+ [Phi-3 Microsoft Blog](https://aka.ms/phi3blog-april)
+ [Phi-3 Technical Report](https://aka.ms/phi3-tech-report)
+ [Phi-3 on Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/phi3-azure-ai)
+ Phi-3 ONNX: [128K](https://aka.ms/Phi3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx)

## Intended Uses

**Primary use cases**

The model is intended for commercial and research use in English. The model provides uses for applications which require:

1) Memory/compute constrained environments
2) Latency bound scenarios
3) Strong reasoning (especially code, math and logic)

Our model is designed to accelerate research on language and multimodal models, for use as a building block for generative AI powered features. 

**Use case considerations**

Our models are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fariness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high risk scenarios. Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case.

Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.  

## How to Use

Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct has been integrated in the development version (4.40.0) of `transformers`. Until the official version is released through `pip`, ensure that you are doing one of the following:

* When loading the model, ensure that `trust_remote_code=True` is passed as an argument of the `from_pretrained()` function.

* Update your local `transformers` to the development version: `pip uninstall -y transformers && pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers`. The previous command is an alternative to cloning and installing from the source.

The current `transformers` version can be verified with: `pip list | grep transformers`.

### Chat Format

Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct model is best suited for prompts using the chat format as follows.
You can provide the prompt as a question with a generic template as follow:
```markdown
<|user|>\nQuestion<|end|>\n<|assistant|>
```
For example:
```markdown
<|system|>
You are a helpful AI assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>
How to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
```

where the model generates the text after `<|assistant|>`. In case of few-shots prompt, the prompt can be formatted as the following:

```markdown
<|system|>
You are a helpful AI assistant.<|end|>
<|user|>
I am going to Paris, what should I see?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
Paris, the capital of France, is known for its stunning architecture, art museums, historical landmarks, and romantic atmosphere. Here are some of the top attractions to see in Paris:\n\n1. The Eiffel Tower: The iconic Eiffel Tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world and offers breathtaking views of the city.\n2. The Louvre Museum: The Louvre is one of the world's largest and most famous museums, housing an impressive collection of art and artifacts, including the Mona Lisa.\n3. Notre-Dame Cathedral: This beautiful cathedral is one of the most famous landmarks in Paris and is known for its Gothic architecture and stunning stained glass windows.\n\nThese are just a few of the many attractions that Paris has to offer. With so much to see and do, it's no wonder that Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world."<|end|>
<|user|>
What is so great about #1?<|end|>
<|assistant|>
```

### Sample inference code

This code snippets show how to get quickly started with running the model on a GPU:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

torch.random.manual_seed(0)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct", 
    device_map="cuda", 
    torch_dtype="auto", 
    trust_remote_code=True, 
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct")

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful digital assistant. Please provide safe, ethical and accurate information to the user."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you provide ways to eat combinations of bananas and dragonfruits?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are some ways to eat bananas and dragonfruits together: 1. Banana and dragonfruit smoothie: Blend bananas and dragonfruits together with some milk and honey. 2. Banana and dragonfruit salad: Mix sliced bananas and dragonfruits together with some lemon juice and honey."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What about solving an 2x + 3 = 7 equation?"},
]

pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)

generation_args = {
    "max_new_tokens": 500,
    "return_full_text": False,
    "temperature": 0.0,
    "do_sample": False,
}

output = pipe(messages, **generation_args)
print(output[0]['generated_text'])
```

## Responsible AI Considerations

Like other language models, the Phi series models can potentially behave in ways that are unfair, unreliable, or offensive. Some of the limiting behaviors to be aware of include:

+ Quality of Service: the Phi models are trained primarily on English text. Languages other than English will experience worse performance. English language varieties with less representation in the training data might experience worse performance than standard American English.   
+ Representation of Harms & Perpetuation of Stereotypes: These models can over- or under-represent groups of people, erase representation of some groups, or reinforce demeaning or negative stereotypes. Despite safety post-training, these limitations may still be present due to differing levels of representation of different groups or prevalence of examples of negative stereotypes in training data that reflect real-world patterns and societal biases. 
+ Inappropriate or Offensive Content: these models may produce other types of inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case. 
+ Information Reliability: Language models can generate nonsensical content or fabricate content that might sound reasonable but is inaccurate or outdated.  
+ Limited Scope for Code: Majority of Phi-3 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as "typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.   

Developers should apply responsible AI best practices and are responsible for ensuring that a specific use case complies with relevant laws and regulations (e.g. privacy, trade, etc.). Important areas for consideration include:

+ Allocation: Models may not be suitable for scenarios that could have consequential impact on legal status or the allocation of resources or life opportunities (ex: housing, employment, credit, etc.) without further assessments and additional debiasing techniques.
+ High-Risk Scenarios: Developers should assess suitability of using models in high-risk scenarios where unfair, unreliable or offensive outputs might be extremely costly or lead to harm. This includes providing advice in sensitive or expert domains where accuracy and reliability are critical (ex: legal or health advice). Additional safeguards should be implemented at the application level according to the deployment context. 
+ Misinformation: Models may produce inaccurate information. Developers should follow transparency best practices and inform end-users they are interacting with an AI system. At the application level, developers can build feedback mechanisms and pipelines to ground responses in use-case specific, contextual information, a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).   
+ Generation of Harmful Content: Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers or custom solutions appropriate for their use case. 
+ Misuse: Other forms of misuse such as fraud, spam, or malware production may be possible, and developers should ensure that their applications do not violate applicable laws and regulations.

## Training

### Model

* Architecture: Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct has 3.8B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model. The model is fine-tuned with Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to ensure alignment with human preferences and safety guidlines.
* Inputs: Text. It is best suited for prompts using chat format.
* Context length: 128K tokens
* GPUs: 512 H100-80G
* Training time: 7 days
* Training data: 3.3T tokens
* Outputs: Generated text in response to the input
* Dates: Our models were trained between February and April 2024
* Status: This is a static model trained on an offline dataset with cutoff date October 2023. Future versions of the tuned models may be released as we improve models.

### Datasets

Our training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 3.3 trillion tokens, and is a combination of 
1) Publicly available documents filtered rigorously for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code; 
2) Newly created synthetic, ‚Äútextbook-like‚Äù data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.); 
3) High quality chat format supervised data covering various topics to reflect human preferences on different aspects such as instruct-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness.

### Fine-tuning

A basic example of multi-GPUs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with TRL and Accelerate modules is provided [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct/resolve/main/sample_finetune.py).

## Benchmarks

We report the results for Phi-3-Mini-128K-Instruct on standard open-source benchmarks measuring the model's reasoning ability (both common sense reasoning and logical reasoning). We compare to Phi-2, Mistral-7b-v0.1, Mixtral-8x7b, Gemma 7B, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and GPT-3.5.

All the reported numbers are produced with the exact same pipeline to ensure that the numbers are comparable. These numbers might differ from other published numbers due to slightly different choices in the evaluation.

As is now standard, we use few-shot prompts to evaluate the models, at temperature 0. 
The prompts and number of shots are part of a Microsoft internal tool to evaluate language models, and in particular we did no optimization to the pipeline for Phi-3.
More specifically, we do not change prompts, pick different few-shot examples, change prompt format, or do any other form of optimization for the model.

The number of k‚Äìshot examples is listed per-benchmark.

## Software

* [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
* [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)
* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [Flash-Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention)

## Hardware
Note that by default, the Phi-3-mini model uses flash attention, which requires certain types of GPU hardware to run. We have tested on the following GPU types:
* NVIDIA A100
* NVIDIA A6000
* NVIDIA H100

If you want to run the model on:
* NVIDIA V100 or earlier generation GPUs: call AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained() with attn_implementation="eager"
* Optimized inference on GPU, CPU, and Mobile: use the **ONNX** models [128K](https://aka.ms/phi3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx)

## Cross Platform Support

ONNX runtime ecosystem now supports Phi-3 Mini models across platforms and hardware. You can find the optimized Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct ONNX model [here](https://aka.ms/phi3-mini-128k-instruct-onnx).

Optimized Phi-3 models are also published here in ONNX format, to run with ONNX Runtime on CPU and GPU across devices, including server platforms, Windows, Linux and Mac desktops, and mobile CPUs, with the precision best suited to each of these targets. DirectML support lets developers bring hardware acceleration to Windows devices at scale across AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs.  
Along with DirectML, ONNX Runtime provides cross platform support for Phi-3 across a range of devices CPU, GPU, and mobile.

Here are some of the optimized configurations we have added: 

1. ONNX models for int4 DML: Quantized to int4 via AWQ
2. ONNX model for fp16 CUDA
3. ONNX model for int4 CUDA: Quantized to int4 via RTN
4. ONNX model for int4 CPU and Mobile: Quantized to int4 via RTN
